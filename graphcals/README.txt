User Interface:
    Switch Between Julia and Mandelbrot graphs: hover over point that the
        Julia set needs to be calculated for in the Mandelbrot view and press
        'J'.  To switch back to Mandelbrot, simply press 'J' again.
    Zoom on point:  Hover mouse cursor over the point of interest and press
        '+' to zoom in or '-' to zoom out. Alternatively, hover over the point
        of interest and scroll the mouse wheel up and down.
    Pan:  To pan, around on the Mandelbrot set, use the arrow keys.  Think of
        this as moving the viewport and not the set itself.  So by pressing the
        down arrow, the set will move upwards in the window since the viewport
        is moving down in world scene coordinates.
    Switching Color palettes:  There are 5 static color sets that we have
        implemented.  To cycle through these, press 'C'.
        To generate a random color set of random numbers, press 'R'
    Animate Colors: To set the colors in animation of random colors, press 'A'
    Switch between parallel and serial mode: To switch between using the CPU
        and the GPU to compute points, press 'V'
    Exiting:  Press 'ESC' to exit the program
